# 1.0 The context

## 1.1 What are Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)?
Cardiovascular disease can refer to a number of conditions:

- Heart disease
- Heart attack
- Stroke
- Heart failure
- Arrhythmia
- Heart valve problems

## 1.2 Key Facts

**Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)** are the **leading cause of death globally**, taking an estimated **17.9 million lives each year**. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one **third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.**

**The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and obesity. These “intermediate risks factors” can be measured in primary care facilities and indicate an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and other complications.**

**Cessation of tobacco use, reduction of salt in the diet, eating more fruit and vegetables, regular physical activity and avoiding harmful use of alcohol have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.** Health policies that create conducive environments for making healthy choices affordable and available are essential for motivating people to adopt and sustain healthy behaviours.

**Identifying those at highest risk of CVDs and ensuring they receive appropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths.** Access to **noncommunicable disease medicines and basic health technologies** in all primary health care facilities is essential to **ensure that those in need receive treatment and counselling.**

## 1.3 Know Your Risk for Heart Disease

**Several health conditions, your lifestyle, and your age and family history can increase your risk for heart disease. These are called risk factors. About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking.1**

Some risk factors for heart disease cannot be controlled, such as your age or family history. But you can take steps to lower your risk by changing the factors you can control.

## 1.4 What behaviors increase the risk of heart disease?
Your lifestyle can increase your risk for heart disease.

**Eating a diet high in saturated** fats, trans fat, and cholesterol has been linked to heart disease and related conditions, such as atherosclerosis. Also, too much salt (sodium) in the diet can raise blood pressure.

**Not getting enough physical activity** can lead to heart disease. It can also increase the chances of having other medical conditions that are risk factors, including obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Regular physical activity can lower your risk for heart disease.

**Drinking too much alcohol** can raise blood pressure levels and the risk for heart disease. It also increases levels of triglycerides, a fatty substance in the blood which can increase the risk for heart disease.
- Women should have no more than 1 drink a day.
- Men should have no more than 2 drinks a day. 

**Tobacco** use increases the risk for heart disease and heart attack:
- Cigarette smoking can damage the heart and blood vessels, which increases your risk for heart conditions such as atherosclerosis and heart attack.
- Nicotine raises blood pressure.
- Carbon monoxide from cigarette smoke reduces the amount of oxygen that your blood can carry.
- Exposure to secondhand smoke can also increase the risk for heart disease, even for nonsmokers.

## 1.5 Some theory behind blood pressure
 What do the numbers mean?
 
Everyone would like to have healthy blood pressure. But what exactly does that mean?
 
When your doctor takes your blood pressure, it’s expressed as a measurement with two numbers, with one number on top **(systolic)** and one on the bottom **(diastolic)**, like a fraction. For example, 120/80 mm Hg.

The top number refers to the amount of pressure in your arteries during the contraction of your heart muscle. This is called **systolic pressure**.

The bottom number refers to your blood pressure when your heart muscle is between beats. This is called **diastolic pressure**.Both numbers are important in determining the state of your heart health.Numbers greater than the ideal range indicate that your heart is working too hard to pump blood to the rest of your body. 


## 1.6 What’s a normal reading?
For a normal reading, your blood pressure needs to show a top number (systolic pressure) that’s between 90 and less than 120 and a bottom number (diastolic pressure) that’s between 60 and less than 80. The American Heart Association (AHA) considers blood pressure to be within the normal range when both your systolic and diastolic numbers are in these ranges.Blood pressure readings are expressed in millimeters of mercury. This unit is abbreviated as mm Hg. A normal reading would be any blood pressure below 120/80 mm Hg and above 90/60 mm Hg in an adult.If you’re in the normal range, no medical intervention is needed. However, you should maintain a healthy lifestyle and healthy weight to help prevent hypertension from developing. Regular exercise and healthy eating can also help. You may need to be even more mindful of your lifestyle if hypertension runs in your family.

## 1.7 Elevated blood pressure
 Numbers higher than 120/80 mm Hg are a red flag that you need to take on heart-healthy habits.
 
 When your systolic pressure is between 120 and 129 mm Hg and your diastolic pressure is less than 80 mm Hg, it means you have elevated blood pressure.
 
Although these numbers aren’t technically considered high blood pressure, you’ve moved out of the normal range. Elevated blood pressure has a good chance of turning into actual high blood pressure, which puts you at an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.

No medications are necessary for elevated blood pressure. But this is when you should adopt healthier lifestyle choices. A balanced diet and regular exercise can help lower your blood pressure to a healthy range and help prevent elevated blood pressure from developing into full-fledged hypertension. 

# 1.8 Diagnosing Hypertension
 One high blood pressure reading is not enough for a diagnosis of hypertension. Most people will have higher readings when under physical or emotional stress. Blood pressure should be measured when you are relaxed and rested. Listed below are several ways to find out whether you have hypertension.

A doctor will diagnose hypertension right away if your **blood pressure is extremely high (higher than 200/120 mmHg).** If your blood pressure is higher than 180/110 mmHg, then your doctor will be able to diagnose you with hypertension after just two visits over a short period of time. If your blood pressure is higher than 160/100 mmHg, then three visits are enough. If your blood pressure is higher than 140/90 mmHg, then five visits are needed before a diagnosis can be made. If either your systolic or diastolic blood pressure stays high, then the diagnosis of hypertension can be made. The diagnosis can also be made if you have diabetes or kidney disease and a blood pressure higher than 130/80 mmHg.

If your systolic pressure is elevated and your diastolic pressure is not, that doesn’t mean you have isolated systolic hypertension. It most likely means you have standard high blood pressure.

While the definition can vary by a person's age, weight, and health, isolated **systolic hypertension is usually diagnosed when the systolic value is extremely high, often close to 200 mmHg.**

"Regular" high blood pressure is typically diagnosed when used an adult has a systolic blood pressure of 130mmHg or higher and/or a diastolic pressure of 80mmHg or above. Your doctor will be able to tell the difference.  

# 1.9 And low blood pressure?
 Low blood pressure does not have a specific number where it is too low. Most doctors consider blood pressure to be too low when it causes symptoms or drops suddenly. In general, low blood pressure symptoms happen when **blood pressure is less than 90/60 mmHg.**
 
The causes of low blood pressure can range from dehydration to serious medical disorders. It's important to find out what's causing your low blood pressure so that it can be treated.

In one of the observational studies, published Oct. 16, 2016, in the **Journal of the American College of Cardiology,** researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 11,000 adults collected over a period of three decades as part of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. They found that people who had **low diastolic blood pressure (60 to 69 mm Hg)** were twice as likely to have subtle evidence of **heart damage** compared with people whose diastolic blood pressure was 80 to 89 mm Hg. Low diastolic values were also linked with a higher risk of heart disease and death from any cause over 21 years.

For the second, published Oct. 29, 2016, in The Lancet, researchers analyzed data from CLARIFY, a registry of more than 22,600 people with heart disease from 45 countries. They determined that, compared with people who had systolic blood pressure of 120 to 139 mm Hg and diastolic pressure of 70 to 79, people with a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher were more likely to experience heart attacks or strokes, to be hospitalized with heart failure, or to die within a five-year period. But the same was true **for heart attacks, heart failure, and death in people with low blood pressure (systolic pressure below 120 mm Hg and diastolic pressure under 70 mm Hg).**

In an analysis published online April 5, 2017, by The Lancet, German researchers pooled data from two clinical trials involving 31,000 men and women ages 55 or older who had cardiovascular disease or advanced diabetes. Participants were assigned to take either ramipril (Altace), telmisartan (Micardis, Activin), both drugs, or neither drug for about five years. The researchers determined that systolic pressures below 120 mm Hg and diastolic pressures below 70 mm Hg were associated with an increased risk of dying from heart disease or any cause compared with systolic pressures between 120 mm Hg and 140 mm Hg and diastolic pressures between 70 and 80 mm Hg. Diastolic pressures of less than 70 mm Hg were also associated with an increased risk of having a heart attack and hospital-ization for heart failure. 

# 2.0 Can the human right ventricle create a negative diastolic pressure suggestive of suction?

Pressure in the right ventricle (RV) as well as the right atrium (RA) and pulmonary artery (PA) were measured in 80 patients with catheter-tip micromanometers and evaluated to determine if the pressures are compatible with the concept of RV diastolic suction. 

In 40 patients with normal PA pressure, minimal RV diastolic pressure that occurred during early filling, was negative (-2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg) (mean +/- SEM). In 29 patients with PA hypertension, minimal RV diastolic pressure during expiration also was negative (-2 +/- 0.7 mm Hg). In 11 patients with right ventricular failure, however, minimal RV diastolic pressure was positive (9 +/- 2 mm Hg). These results indicate that the human right ventricle, in the absence of failure, has a negative early diastolic pressure, which may reflect RV diastolic suction.

## 2.1 How do genetics and family history affect the risk of heart disease?

Genetic factors likely play some role in high blood pressure, heart disease, and other related conditions. However, it is also likely that people with a family history of heart disease share common environments and other factors that may increase their risk.

The risk for heart disease can increase even more when heredity combines with unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as smoking cigarettes and eating an unhealthy diet.

Heart disease is the **leading cause of death** for people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States, including African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and white people. For Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and Hispanics, heart disease is second only to cancer.3

# 2.0 The challenges

Cardio Catch Diseases is a company specialized in detecting heart disease in the early stages. Its business model lies in offering an early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease for a certain price.

Currently, the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease is manually made by a team of specialists. The current accuracy of the diagnosis varies between 55% and 65%, due to the complexity of the diagnosis and also the fatigue of the team who take turns to minimize the risks. The cost of each diagnosis, including the devices and the payroll of the analysts, is around $1,000.00.

The price of the diagnosis, paid by the client, varies according to the precision achieved by the team of specialists.

| Exam Accuracy | Price          | Rules                                    | Example                         |
|:--------------|:---------------|:-----------------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
| Above 50%     | min \$500\.00  | \+\$500 for each additional 5% precision | Precision = 55% \-> \$1,000\.00 |
| Up to 50%     | $0\.00         | N/A                                      | N/A                             |

Thus, we see that **different values in the exam precision**, given by the team of specialists, make the company either have a profitable operation, revenue greater than the cost, or an operation with a loss, revenue less than the cost. This instability of the diagnosis makes the company to have an **unpredictable cashflow**.
